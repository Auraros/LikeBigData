### 题目信息

查询收入第二高的员工薪水，如果没有收入第二高的员工，则返回 null。

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee Table. For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

### 代码

自己写的代码

```
SELECT Salary as SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1,1;
```

这样可以查出第二个数据，但是无法显示 null



修改：使用一个子查询就可以解决这个问题：

```
SELECT (SELECT salary FROM employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1,1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```



**答案**

```
SELECT(
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

类似之前我提到的，如果没用子查询，会有一样的问题：当没有薪水第二高的人的时候，返回的不是null值。

注意：必须加 DISTINCT, 否则当不止一个人有第二高薪水的时候会返回多个值。



### 网友答案1

```
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
```

```
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

```
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN Salary ELSE null END) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM (
SELECT Salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk FROM Employee
) AS tmp 
```
